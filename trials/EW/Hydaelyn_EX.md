# Hydaelyn Extreme
1. Assign number (1 & 2) to each healer, have raid split in two (one for each healer)
2. Decide how raid such split per role for *Infralateral Arc*

## Phase 1
### Crystallize
  * displays Element followed by weapon **but weapon attack before element executed**.
  * Weapon:
    * RED (chakrams): {IN} donut AOE (around hitbox)
    * GREEN (staff) : {OUT} PBAOE (bigger than hitbox)
    * BLUE (sword)  : {CROSS} cross aoe. go to inter-cardinal points
  * Elements:
    * Water: {Dual Stack} everyone stacks on designated healer
    * Ice: {Spread} all raid spread
    * Earth: {Stack} Raid should stack on tank
  * `Aureole` = {get on side} MASSIVE AOE behind and front
  * `Lateral Aureole` = {get behind} MASSIVE AOE on sides

1. {R_AOE} `Hero's Radiance` *(happens 20-25s in fight, pre-pull Succor will soak it)*
2. {Stack} `Shining Saber`
3. **Crystallize** > {R_AOE} `Radiance` / {TB} `Scorn` > random **Aureole** > 
4. **Crystallize** > {TB} / {R_AOE} > random **Aureole** 
5. **Crystallize** *(always swords + water/earth ??)*

## Phase 2 (Adds + Crystals)
small {R_AOE} at beginning + big {R_AOE} at end
* **Tanks** should tank adds OPPOSITE to shining crystals and raid
* **dps** should destroy shining crystals first
* **healers** beware dmg on tank is high
After crystals destroyed: massive {R_AOE} (99% meter = 25k dmg)  
*NOTE: the phase lasts a little more than 90s, so using big CD for first {R_AOE} is okay, as it will be available for the end  
SCH NOTE: aetherflow right before phase, you can use up all 3 stacks & have an aetherflow for sacred soil for Ultimate.*

## Phase 3
{R_AOE} `Halo`
### Lightwave 1
1. 2 waves on north side, 
   * go to north east/west crystal, block line of sight.  
   * After two crystal have been hit: split into roles behind each crystal.  
   * *common strat: heals stay, dps middle, tank far away*
2. 3 waves: 2 on side + 1 middle (late).
   * get behind boss for `Hero's Glory`
   * get behind middle crystal for wave dodging
   * for last wave (+ another `Hero's Glory`): get **crystal behind boss**
   * {R_AOE} right after


## Phase 4
repeat of mechanics from <a href="#Phase 1">Phase 1</a> + others:
* {TB} `Hero's Sundering`
* `Parhelion`: Get between 1st and 2nd chakram throw. {Healer 1} stacks in middle & {Healer 2} stacks far on edge. After **Water** run into 1st chakram throw line.  
__*(immediately after)*__ 
* `Aureole`


## Phase 5
### Lightwave 2
1. 4 light waves: Find safe corner. Nothing special.
2. {Stack} entire raid. Multiple hits stay stacked.
3. {Spread} everyone but tank should spread.
4. {TB_Shared} tanks should stack together.
5. 4 light waves: **CENTER is safe**
phase repeats before enrage  
if {LHP_Stack}`Water Crystallize` + `Shining Saber` => `Shining Saber` will hit first.
